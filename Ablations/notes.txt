Ablation study review

current performance:
- accuracy: 65.6% (meh)
- f1-score: 0.146 (YIKES)
- auc: 0.760 (could be worse i guess)

THE GOOD NEWS:
found some super important features that actually matter:
1. total_packets- this one is HUGE (67% importance)
2. protocol- also really important (54%)
3. bytes_per_packet- solid (39%)
4. duration- decent (33%)
5. total_bytes- okay (32%)
6. packets_per_second- not bad (30%)

THE BAD NEWS:
some features are literally making things WORSE:
- state_encoded: when i remove this, f1 goes from 0.146 to 0.379 (!!)
- src_load: f1 jumps to 0.366 without it
- load_ratio: f1 becomes 0.300 without it
- src_bytes_ratio: f1 goes to 0.239 without it

USELESS FEATURES:
a bunch of features do literally nothing:
- dst_packets, src_packets, dst_bytes, src_bytes
- bytes_per_second, trans_depth, ct_src_dport_ltm
- src_packets_ratio, ct_dst_sport_ltm, mean_packet_size
removing them = exact same f1 score (0.146)

CORRELATION MATRIX FINDINGS:
- tons of features are basically the same thing (correlation > 0.9)
- byte-related features are all super correlated
- load features have perfect correlation (r ≈ 1.0)
- rate features are also highly correlated

WHAT I NEED TO DO:

IMMEDIATE FIXES (should 2x my f1 score):
1. DELETE the harmful features (state_encoded, src_load, load_ratio, src_bytes_ratio)
- this alone should get me from f1=0.146 to f1~0.38
2. keep only the top important features
3. get rid of all the redundant stuff

MEDIUM TERM:
- fix the quantization (currently quantizing everything including useless features)
- tune the algorithms better

PRIORITY:
1. remove bad features (HIGH- easy win)
2. feature selection (MEDIUM- keep top 6-8)
3. algorithm tuning (LOW- more complex)

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- removing bad features alone: f1 = 0.146 → 0.38 (160% improvement)
- with all optimizations: hopefully f1 > 0.5
- dream scenario: f1 > 0.7
