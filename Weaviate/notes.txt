How BQ-LSH is doing well
- High Recall (87.2%): 
    - Captures almost all anomalies- critical on the edge where false negatives are costly.
- Optimized Flow Speed: 
    - Although total test time is longer, per-flow processing is highly optimized (~1.47 ms/flow on average).
- Compact Model Footprint:
    - LSH Model Size: ~26.2 KB
    - Embedding tables, hash functions, quantizer, and IF/SVM baseline combined still fit under ~30 KB 
- Predictable Resource Usage:
    - Memory and CPU consumption are bounded and localized, unlike full-featured external services like Weaviate.
    - No need to serialize/deserialize objects between components.
- No Additional Infrastructure:
    - BQ-LSH can run inline on the switch pipeline or edge node without needing HTTP APIs or Dockerized inference servers.
    - Avoids Weaviate’s extra abstraction layer which adds latency and complexity.

Weaviate drawbacks for edge
- Requires additional container runtime  RAM, and CPU headroom.
- Typical memory usage during training is ~256 KB, but Weaviate itself adds significant overhead:
    - Weaviate server RAM footprint: ~400–800 MB idle
    - Requires space for Docker images, GraphQL engine, and embedded vector DBs
    - Full installation may consume >1 GB disk space.
- Models like Isolation Forest/SVM in Weaviate are fast overall, but not flow-optimized- good throughput, but not real-time per-flow.
- Low recall (22%) makes them unreliable for security-focused edge detection tasks.

Efficiency Gains
- Speed Efficiency (LSH vs Baseline): 1.36× faster
- Memory Efficiency:
  - LSH vs Isolation Forest: 558.67× more memory-efficient
  - LSH vs One-Class SVM: 558.67× more memory-efficient

TL;DR
BQ-LSH is built for edge-native anomaly detection- fast, light, and with strong anomaly recall.
Weaviate is better suited to centralized or cloud-based analysis where throughput and ease of integration matter more than tight resource control.
